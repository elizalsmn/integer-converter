# Integer Converter

This is a simple converter program that takes an integer in the range [1, 1000] and converts it to its binary, octal, and hexadecimal representation.

## Files

The following files are included in this folder:

- `main3.cpp`: The main program file that contains the user interface and handles input/output.
- `d2boh.cpp`: The implementation file that contains the functions to convert the integer to binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
- `makefile`: The makefile that automates the compilation and linking process.
- `d2boh.h`: The header file that declares the functions used in `d2boh.cpp`.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the files.

3. Run the following command to compile the program:

   ```shell
   make main3
   ```
4. Once the compilation is successful, run the program using the following command:
   ```shell
   ./main3
   ```
6. The program will display the binary, octal, and hexadecimal representation of the entered integer.
7. The program will prompt you to enter an integer in the range [1, 1000]. Enter a valid integer and press Enter.
